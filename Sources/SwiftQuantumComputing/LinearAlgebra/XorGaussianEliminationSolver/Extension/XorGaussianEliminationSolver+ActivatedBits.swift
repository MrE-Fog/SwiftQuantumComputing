     Find all possible solutions for a system of XOR equations.

     - Parameter equations: List of equations where each equation is represented by a binary string. For example,
     the following equation: x2 ^ x0 = 0, is represented with this string: '101'.

     - Returns: A list of solutions where each solution is a binary string. If a system of equations if composed of variables:
     x0, x1 & x2 and in a given solution x1=0 while x0=1 & x2=1, the string for this solutions is: '101'
