/**
 Implementation of Gaussian elimination algorithm for system of XOR equations, i.e. equations like the following:
 x2 ^ x1 ^ x0 = 0.
 */
public protocol XorGaussianEliminationSolver {

    /**
     Find all possible solutions for a system of XOR equations.

     - Parameter equations: Set of equations where each equation is represented by a set of indexes. For example,
     the following equation: x2 ^ x0 = 0, is represented with this set: (2, 0).

     - Returns: A list of solutions where each solution is a list of indexes. If a system of equations if composed of variables:
     x0, x1 & x2 and in a given solution x1=0 while x0=1 & x2=1, the list of indexes for this solutions is: (2, 0)
