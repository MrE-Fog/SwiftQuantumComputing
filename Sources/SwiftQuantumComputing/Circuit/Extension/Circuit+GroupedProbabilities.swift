     Initializes circuit with `initialBits` and applies `gates` to get the probability of each possible combination of qubits

     in `summaryQubits` conditioned to measure the aformentioned combination in the qubits in `groupQubits`.
     This is equivalent to get the probability of each possible combination of qubits in `summaryQubits` after collapsing
     the qubits in `groupQubits` with a measurement.

     - Parameter groupQubits: List of qubits for which we want to know the probability of each combination.
     - Parameter summaryQubits: List of qubits for which we want to know the probability of each combination once the
     qubits in `groupQubits` collapse to a value. if an empty list is provided, an empty summary will be returned.
     - Parameter initialBits: String composed only of 0's & 1's. If not provided, a sequence of 0's will be used instead.
     - Parameter places: If provided, probabilities in each summary are rounded to the given number of decimal `places`.
     Notice that if a probability ends up rounded to 0.0, it is removed from the summary.

     - Returns: A dictionary where each key is a combination of qubits in `groupQubits` and its value the probability of
     such combination plus another dictionary where each key is a combination of qubits in `summaryQubits` and its value
     the probability of such combination if qubits in `groupQubits` collapse to the first key. Combinations with

     the probability of such combination if qubits in `groupQubits` collapse to the first key. Combinations with
