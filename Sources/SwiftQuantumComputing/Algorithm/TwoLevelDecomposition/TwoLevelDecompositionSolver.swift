/// A quantum gate can be decomposed into a sequence of fully controlled two-level matrix gates and not gates.
/// The following implementation is based on:
/// [Decomposition of unitary matrices and quantum gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7366) &
/// [Decomposition of unitary matrix into quantum gates](https://github.com/fedimser/quantum_decomp/blob/master/res/Fedoriaka2019Decomposition.pdf)

     Decompose `gate` into a sequence of fully controlled two-level matrix gates and not gates.

     - Parameter qubitCount: Number of qubits in the circuit.

     - Returns: A sequence of `Gate` instances that replace the input `gate`. Or `QuantumOperatorError` error.
